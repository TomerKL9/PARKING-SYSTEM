This document outlines the design and implementation details for a
comprehensive parking system project. The project is divided into three main
parts: a TCP Server capable of handling multiple clients and processing
parking data, a Database (DB) for storing pricing information and customer
data, and a system integrating STM32 microcontroller and BeagleBone Black
(BBB) for emulating GPS coordinates and transmitting them to the server.
